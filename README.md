The initial round of major funding was by Ignition Partners in the amount of approximately twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000.00) in 2007.  The Company made an initial public offering- traded on the NASDAQ - in 2012 and traded under the symbol SPLK.  It completed a buy-out by CISCO in 2024 for approximately twenty-eight billions dollars ($28,000,000,000.00).  The merger into CISCO was completed in March 2024.

## Business Activities

* What specific problems is the company or project trying to solve? Splunk is intended for large firms that have to address “big data” including machine-generated data.  It allows enterprise users to collect, manage, and search through large amounts of machine-generated data.  It provides a way for organizations to engage in analytics, compliance and security; and is transitioning to the use of AI and Machine Learning to push the limits of how its customers can identify trends, anticipate problems, and think through solutions through the use of AI technologies and tools.
_The source of this information includes the most recent 10Q filed by the company that identifies its strength and what the company does and intends to do._

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?  The intended customer are Enterprise users (think - Fortune 500 companies) that harvest massive amount of data and need a roadmap through their systems to properly use them.  A pharmaceutical company with massive compliance obligations, trade secrets protections concerns, collaboration needs, and an ongoing need of market insight would be able to take advantage of Splunk.  A startup research company, by contrast, would need a different solution more attuned to their needs.  The market size of the companies and entities that use Splunk are national-sized entities.  By way of example, Splunk has a project it launched during COVID to

> “simulat[e] the Entire US Pharmaceutical Supply Chain with Full-Stack Analytics”

that would be used by government and global pharmaceutical companies.

_The basis of this information is information provided by the company including marketing material as well as disclosures in the most recent 10Q._

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)   Splunk has more than two decades of experience in the market as it has grown from a startup to a multi-billion behemoth that’s become CISCO’s play into AI.  It has the benefit of network effects as data managers have used the system for years and many apps have been developed that plug into Spark to leverage its capabilities; which only further locks it in.  It now has the benefit of being a CISCO company and can be plugged into Fortune 500 companies and government projects.

_The basis for this information is research conducted online about which entities are a good fit for Splunk._

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?  Crunchbase reports that Splunk uses 98 products including HTML5, iQuery, and Google Analytics (ironic, considering the business model).   Broadly, the key APIs and integrations outward from Splunk are about creating apps and interfaces that make it possible and easy for users to access information on any number of platforms (from the iOS to Android ecosystems, including its own suite of apps aimed for different use cases).

_The basis for this information is Crunchbase data (non-subscription, so limited) and the use of those APIs is online articles about how Splunk is largely self-contained and that they are more concerned with making its interface easily usable._

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?  Big Data Management and the transition of Big Data Management companies to AI.

_The basis for this information is its 10Q and public discussions online about the company, including its Wikipedia article._

*  What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 10 years?   The quantity and quality of data available to and used by customers has grown exponentially.  Compliance obligations including the GDPR and local laws in California and elsewhere; as well as regulations and rules that are coming online in many domains, required increased insight into data by large organizations.  The COVID experience superpowered these requirements and in so doing, also created business opportunities for Splunk.   More broadly, management of big data including the implementation of AI has become increasingly important for large firms and organizations.

_The basis of this information is my business knowledge of the development of compliance issues including personal experience in ESI production during litigation; and how that has changed over †he past decade; including other online discussions about developments in the industry._

*  What are the other major companies in the field?  Datadog has the largest market share in the market generally (especially with smaller firms).  There are other competitors including IBM's QRadar SIEM and Microsoft's Sentinel which are similar in their targeting of large companies, but those have not been as widely adopted.   Broadly, there are few companies with as broad a solution portfolio as Splunk (and none with †he market placement to co-market with CISCO) although as identified, there are a number of near-peer compeitors in log-management, use monitoring, and analytic space.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?  Splunk has positioned itself as the major, “safe” solution for large organizations that have a need to analyze huge amounts of data including compliance, security, trade secret protection and similar concerns.  It was first to - and simplest to use - solution, which is why it was a natural partner of CISCO.

_The basis of this information is the 10Q and recent discussions online about the wisdom, or lack thereof, of the merger._

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success?  How is your company performing based on these metrics?  As a public company (and now a component of a public company), its information is public.  In its last 10Q (quarterly report) it reported recurring revenue of four and a quarter billion ($4,208,000,000.00) and net income rose to about a half-billion ($427,000,000.00).  Other “number” metrics used by the company are number of large customers, and they reported in their last quarter an increase of 109 customers for a total customer base of 899 “large” (total annual recurrent revenue greater than one million dollars) customers.  More broadly, the company is a long-term play and see its position in the market (including the strategic merger with CISCO) as key to its long-term growth.

_The basis for this information are the metrics provided by the Company itself in its 10Q including its emphasis in top-line results._

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?  Splunk is positioning itself well to be the “blue chip” solution and the merger with CISCO (which is unmatched) sets itself up to be placed within all Fortune 500 companies looking for the analytic solutions that Splunk can provide.

##  Recommendations

*  If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)    The company has focused on larger company and can consider a pared down version more appropriate for smaller firms.   In addition, the company should accelerate its transition into AI solutions as its data management capabilities (and the data-rich nature of its clientele) are a good fit for AI to solve many upcoming issues.   That does seem to be the CISCO Strategy, and the advise would be to get Beta products out quickly because the speed of adoption of AI is high and first movers will have a major advntage.

*   Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?   This would broaden its customer base.  Right not it’s dependent on several hundred large firms.  Expanding to smaller entities (especially those which have the potential for growth) can diversify income streams, promote widespread adoption and otherwise grow other potential areas of growth.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?  Given the data held by the users of Splunk, a technology that allows its customers to develop its an in-house LLM (either stand alone or as a top-off of open source LLM solutions) that tune the information available for use to the specific needs of the companies being served. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?  This technology - building an in-house LLM for each customer based on their own massive data mines - would allow the fine-tuning of data analytics and development of AI that’s particularly appropriate for each customer.  Rather than a crude ChatGPT hammer that’s more of a broad solution but often inappropriate for particular use cases.
